        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",

        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-27\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-06-12\\nTitle: Exploring Fact Memorization and Style Imitation in LLMs Using QLoRA: An Experimental Study and Quality Assessment Methods\\nAuthors: Eugene Vyborov, Oleksiy Osypenko, Serge Sotnyk\\nSummary: There are various methods for adapting LLMs to different domains.

The paper introduces several innovations to save memory without sacrificing performance, such as 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), double quantization, and paged optimizers. The best model family, Guanaco, outperforms all previous openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the performance level of ChatGPT with only 24 hours of finetuning on a single GPU.\\n\\n### Latest Information on Authors\\n\\n#### Tim Dettmers\\n- **Latest Tweet**: Unfortunately, I encountered a rate limit error while trying to fetch the latest tweet for Tim Dettmers.\\n\\n#### Artidoro Pagnoni\\n- **Latest Tweet**: Unfortunately, I encountered a rate limit error while trying to fetch the latest tweet for Artidoro Pagnoni.\\n\\n#### Ari Holtzman\\n- **Latest Tweet**: Unfortunately, I encountered a rate limit error while trying to fetch the latest tweet for Ari Holtzman.\\n\\n#### Luke Zettlemoyer\\n- **Latest Tweet**: Unfortunately, I encountered a rate limit error while trying to fetch the latest tweet for Luke Zettlemoyer.\\n\\nI recommend checking their Twitter profiles directly for the most recent updates.', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 377, 'prompt_tokens': 2521, 'total_tokens': 2898}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-05-13', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_157b3831f5', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-d03bbf19-1993-4a99-aa43-fd1845072ff4-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2521, 'output_tokens': 377, 'total_tokens': 2898})]\n",

              "'RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to improve the performance of language models by combining retrieval-based methods with generative models. Here‚Äôs a brief overview of how it works:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval**: In the first step, the system retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a large corpus or database. This is typically done using a retrieval model, such as BM25 or a dense retrieval model like DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval).\\n\\n2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved documents are then used to augment the input to the generative model. This means that the generative model has access to additional context or information that can help it produce more accurate and relevant responses.\\n\\n3. **Generation**: Finally, the generative model, such as GPT-3 or BERT, uses the augmented input to generate a response. The additional context provided by the retrieved documents helps the model generate more informed and contextually appropriate responses.\\n\\nRAG is particularly useful in scenarios where the generative model might not have enough information to generate a high-quality response on its own. By leveraging external knowledge sources, RAG can significantly enhance the performance of language models in tasks such as question answering, dialogue systems, and information retrieval.'"

This ensures that the workflow progresses in a single direction.\\n\\n3. **Graph**: It is a collection of nodes (tasks) and edges (dependencies between tasks).\\n\\n### Components of a DAG\\n\\n- **Tasks**: The individual units of work that need to be performed.\\n- **Dependencies**: The relationships between tasks that dictate the order in which they should be executed.\\n\\n### Example\\n\\nHere is a simple example of a DAG in Airflow:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom airflow import DAG\\nfrom airflow.operators.dummy_operator import DummyOperator\\nfrom datetime import datetime\\n\\n# Define the DAG\\ndag = DAG(\\n    'example_dag',\\n    description='An example DAG',\\n    schedule_interval='@daily',\\n    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),\\n    catchup=False\\n)\\n\\n# Define tasks\\nstart = DummyOperator(task_id='start', dag=dag)\\ntask_1 = DummyOperator(task_id='task_1', dag=dag)\\ntask_2 = DummyOperator(task_id='task_2', dag=dag)\\nend = DummyOperator(task_id='end', dag=dag)\\n\\n# Set up dependencies\\nstart >> task_1 >> task_2 >> end\\n```\\n\\nIn this example:\\n- The DAG is named `example_dag`.\\n- It is scheduled to run daily.\\n- It contains four tasks: `start`, `task_1`, `task_2`, and `end`.\\n- The dependencies are set up so that `task_1` runs after `start`, `task_2` runs after `task_1`, and `end` runs after `task_2`.\\n\\n### Key Features\\n\\n- **Scheduling**: DAGs can be scheduled to run at specific intervals.\\n- **Monitoring**: Airflow provides a web interface to monitor the status of DAGs and their tasks.\\n- **Extensibility**: You can define custom operators to perform specific tasks.\\n\\nDAGs are a fundamental concept in Airflow, enabling you to define complex workflows with clear dependencies and scheduling.\",\n",

              "   'output': \"Apache Airflow handles task dependencies using Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). Here‚Äôs a detailed explanation of how it works:\\n\\n1. **DAG Definition**:\\n   - A DAG is a collection of all the tasks you want to run, organized in a way that reflects their relationships and dependencies.\\n   - Each DAG is defined in a Python script, where you can specify the tasks and their dependencies.\\n\\n2. **Task Definition**:\\n   - Tasks are defined as instances of `BaseOperator` or its subclasses (e.g., `PythonOperator`, `BashOperator`).\\n   - Each task represents a single unit of work.\\n\\n3. **Setting Dependencies**:\\n   - Dependencies between tasks are set using the `set_upstream` and `set_downstream` methods or by using bitshift operators (`>>` and `<<`).\\n   - For example:\\n     ```python\\n     task1 >> task2  # task2 depends on task1\\n     task3.set_upstream(task2)  # task3 depends on task2\\n     ```\\n\\n4. **Execution Order**:\\n   - Airflow ensures that tasks are executed in the order defined by the dependencies.\\n   - A task will not run until all its upstream tasks have completed successfully.\\n\\n5. **Handling Cycles**:\\n   - Since DAGs are acyclic, Airflow does not allow cycles in the task dependencies. This ensures that there are no circular dependencies, which could lead to infinite loops.\\n\\n6. **Dynamic Dependencies**:\\n   - Dependencies can be set dynamically within the DAG definition, allowing for complex workflows that can adapt based on conditions or parameters.\\n\\n7. **Task Groups**:\\n   - Airflow 2.0 introduced Task Groups, which allow you to group related tasks together and set dependencies at the group level, making the DAGs more readable and manageable.\\n\\n8. **Trigger Rules**:\\n   - Airflow provides various trigger rules (e.g., `all_success`, `all_failed`, `one_success`, etc.) that determine how dependencies are handled based on the state of upstream tasks.\\n\\nHere is a simple example of a DAG with task dependencies:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom airflow import DAG\\nfrom airflow.operators.dummy_operator import DummyOperator\\nfrom datetime import datetime\\n\\ndefault_args = {\\n    'owner': 'airflow',\\n    'start_date': datetime(2023, 1, 1),\\n}\\n\\nwith DAG('example_dag', default_args=default_args, schedule_interval='@daily') as dag:\\n    start = DummyOperator(task_id='start')\\n    task1 = DummyOperator(task_id='task1')\\n    task2 = DummyOperator(task_id='task2')\\n    end = DummyOperator(task_id='end')\\n\\n    start >> task1 >> task2 >> end\\n```\\n\\nIn this example:\\n- `task1` depends on `start`.\\n- `task2` depends on `task1`.\\n- `end` depends on `task2`.\\n\\nThis ensures that the tasks are executed in the correct order.\",\n",

Here are some key uses of Celery in Python:\\n\\n1. **Asynchronous Task Execution**: Celery allows you to execute tasks asynchronously, meaning that you can run tasks in the background without blocking the main application process.

This ensures that the message is stored on disk rather than just in memory.\\n\\n2. **Durable Queues**:\\n   - Queues can be declared as durable by setting the `durable` parameter to `true` when the queue is created. Durable queues survive broker restarts, meaning that the queue definition itself is stored on disk.\\n\\n3. **Acknowledgments**:\\n   - RabbitMQ uses acknowledgments to ensure that messages are not lost. When a consumer receives a message, it must send an acknowledgment back to RabbitMQ. If RabbitMQ does not receive an acknowledgment, it will requeue the message and deliver it to another consumer.\\n\\n4. **Publisher Confirms**:\\n   - Publisher confirms are an extension to the standard AMQP protocol, providing a lightweight way to ensure that messages have been successfully replicated to disk. When a message is published, the broker sends a confirmation back to the publisher once the message has been safely stored.\\n\\n5. **Mirrored Queues (High Availability)**:\\n   - RabbitMQ supports mirrored queues, where the contents of a queue are replicated across multiple nodes in a cluster. This ensures that even if one node fails, the messages are still available on another node.\\n\\n6. **Transactions**:\\n   - RabbitMQ supports AMQP transactions, allowing a series of operations to be executed atomically. However, transactions can be slower and are generally less preferred compared to publisher confirms.\\n\\nBy combining these features, RabbitMQ provides robust mechanisms to ensure that messages are not lost and can survive broker restarts and failures.',\n",

Here are the key aspects of how FastAPI handles data validation:\\n\\n1. **Pydantic Models**:\\n   - FastAPI uses Pydantic models to define the structure of request bodies, query parameters, and other data inputs.\\n   - Pydantic models are Python classes that inherit from `pydantic.BaseModel`. They define fields with types and optional validation constraints.\\n\\n2. **Automatic Validation**:\\n   - When a request is made, FastAPI automatically validates the incoming data against the defined Pydantic models.\\n   - If the data is valid, it is parsed and passed to the endpoint function as Python objects.\\n   - If the data is invalid, FastAPI returns a detailed error response indicating what went wrong.\\n\\n3. **Field Types and Constraints**:\\n   - Pydantic supports a wide range of field types, including standard Python types (e.g., `int`, `str`, `float`), as well as more complex types (e.g., `List`, `Dict`, `datetime`).\\n   - You can also add constraints to fields, such as `min_length`, `max_length`, `regex`, `gt` (greater than), `lt` (less than), etc.\\n\\n4. **Nested Models**:\\n   - Pydantic models can be nested, allowing for complex data structures to be validated.\\n   - This is useful for validating JSON objects with nested fields.\\n\\n5. **Custom Validators**:\\n   - Pydantic allows you to define custom validation logic using the `@validator` decorator.\\n   - This is useful for implementing complex validation rules that are not covered by standard field constraints.\\n\\n6. **Error Handling**:\\n   - FastAPI provides detailed error messages when validation fails, including the specific field that caused the error and the reason for the failure.\\n   - This makes it easier to debug and handle validation errors.\\n\\nHere is an example of how FastAPI handles data validation using Pydantic:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException\\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field, validator\\nfrom typing import List\\n\\napp = FastAPI()\\n\\nclass Item(BaseModel):\\n    name: str\\n    description: str = None\\n    price: float\\n    tax: float = None\\n\\n    @validator(\\'price\\')\\n    def price_must_be_positive(cls, value):\\n        if value <= 0:\\n            raise ValueError(\\'Price must be positive\\')\\n        return value\\n\\nclass Order(BaseModel):\\n    items: List[Item]\\n    total: float\\n\\n@app.post(\"/orders/\")\\nasync def create_order(order: Order):\\n    return order\\n```\\n\\nIn this example:\\n- The `Item` model defines the structure of an item with fields `name`, `description`, `price`, and `tax`.\\n- A custom validator ensures that the `price` field is positive.\\n- The `Order` model contains a list of `Item` objects and a `total` field.\\n- When a POST request is made to the `/orders/` endpoint, FastAPI validates the incoming data against the `Order` model and its nested `Item` models. If the data is valid, it is passed to the `create_order` function. If not, an error response is returned.',\n",

Here's a detailed breakdown of how it works:\\n\\n1. **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG):**\\n   - A DAG is a collection of tasks organized in a way that reflects their dependencies and execution order. Each DAG defines a workflow, and tasks within the DAG are nodes connected by directed edges that represent dependencies.\\n\\n2. **Scheduling Intervals:**\\n   - Airflow uses scheduling intervals to determine when a DAG should be executed. The scheduling interval can be defined using cron expressions, timedelta objects, or preset strings like `@daily`, `@hourly`, etc.\\n   - The `start_date` parameter specifies when the DAG should start running, and the `schedule_interval` parameter defines how often it should run.\\n\\n3. **Task Dependencies:**\\n   - Within a DAG, tasks can have dependencies on other tasks. These dependencies are defined using methods like `set_upstream` and `set_downstream`, or by using bitwise operators (`>>` and `<<`).\\n   - Airflow ensures that tasks are executed in the correct order based on these dependencies.\\n\\n4. **Task Instances:**\\n   - Each time a DAG is triggered, a DAG run is created, and task instances are generated for each task in the DAG. These task instances are scheduled to run according to the DAG's schedule and dependencies.\\n\\n5. **Scheduler:**\\n   - The Airflow scheduler is responsible for monitoring all DAGs and scheduling their task instances. It checks the scheduling intervals and dependencies to determine when tasks should be executed.\\n   - The scheduler places tasks in a queue, and the Airflow workers pick up tasks from this queue to execute them.\\n\\n6. **Execution:**\\n   - Tasks are executed by Airflow workers, which can run tasks in parallel. The execution of tasks is managed by the Airflow executor, which can be configured to use different backends like LocalExecutor, CeleryExecutor, KubernetesExecutor, etc.\\n\\n7. **Retries and Alerts:**\\n   - Airflow allows configuring retries and alerts for tasks. If a task fails, it can be retried a specified number of times with a delay between retries. Alerts can be set up to notify users of task failures or other events.\\n\\n8. **Backfilling:**\\n   - Airflow supports backfilling, which allows running a DAG for past dates. This is useful for catching up on missed runs or reprocessing data.\\n\\nBy combining these elements, Airflow provides a flexible and powerful way to schedule and manage workflows.\",\n",
