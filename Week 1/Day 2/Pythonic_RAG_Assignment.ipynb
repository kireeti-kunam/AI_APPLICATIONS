    "Benefits of Using an async Approach to Collecting Embeddings\n",
    "Using an async approach to collect embeddings can offer several advantages, especially when dealing with tasks that involve waiting for external resources, like network requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improved Efficiency: In a synchronous approach, each embedding request would have to wait for the previous one to complete before starting. With async, multiple requests can be initiated simultaneously, which allows other tasks to proceed while waiting for the embedding responses. This leads to better utilization of resources and reduced idle time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Faster Execution: Because async operations don’t block the execution of subsequent code, the overall time to collect embeddings can be significantly reduced. Instead of waiting for each request to complete before moving on to the next, multiple requests can be handled in parallel, resulting in faster execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: An async approach scales better when dealing with a large number of embedding requests. It allows your application to handle more requests simultaneously without getting bogged down by waiting times, making it more responsive and capable of handling higher loads.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, adopting an async approach for collecting embeddings can make the process more efficient, faster, and scalable, especially in scenarios where the system has to handle a large number of requests or deal with unpredictable network delays."

    "\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"system\"}` : The system message helps set the behavior of the assistant. For example, you can modify the personality of the assistant or provide specific instructions about how it should behave throughout the conversation. However note that the system message is optional and the model’s behavior without a system message is likely to be similar to using a generic message such as \"You are a helpful assistant.\"\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"user\"}` : The user messages provide requests or comments for the assistant to respond to.\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"assistant\"}` : Assistant messages store previous assistant responses, but can also be written by you to give examples of desired behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You start with a system message that outlines how the LLM should respond, what kind of behaviours you can expect from it, and more\n",
    "2. Then, you can provide a few examples in the form of \"assistant\"/\"user\" pairs\n",
    "3. Then, you prompt the model with the true \"user\" message.\n",

    "\n",
    "Set the temperature to 0:\n",
    "\n",
    "The temperature parameter controls how deterministic or random the model's output will be. By setting the temperature to 0, you make the model's responses more predictable and consistent, which helps in getting reproducible results across different runs.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ensuring that you provide the same prompt every time is crucial for reproducibility. Even small changes in the prompt can lead to different outputs, so keeping it consistent is key.\n",
    "Control the max_tokens and stop Parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "By setting max_tokens, you can limit the length of the generated output, which helps in keeping the responses more predictable. Additionally, using the stop parameter to define where the model should stop generating text can also contribute to more consistent outputs.\n",
    "While complete reproducibility isn't always guaranteed due to the inherent nature of AI models, applying these techniques can significantly reduce variability in the results.\n"

      "Writing a loop in Python can be done in various ways depending on what you want to achieve. Here are some common methods, along with their best practices:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Using a `for` loop**: This is often the most Pythonic way to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string).\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   items = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n",
      "   for item in items:\n",
      "       print(item)\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Using a `while` loop**: This is useful when you want to repeat a block of code as long as a condition is true.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   count = 0\n",
      "   while count < 5:\n",
      "       print(count)\n",
      "       count += 1\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Using `enumerate()` in a `for` loop**: If you need both index and value from a list, `enumerate()` is very handy.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n",
      "   for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):\n",
      "       print(index, fruit)\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Using list comprehensions**: If you're generating a list based on existing list values, list comprehensions are concise and often faster.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]\n",
      "   print(squares)\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Using the `zip()` function**: This is used when you want to iterate over multiple lists at the same time.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']\n",
      "   ages = [25, 30, 35]\n",
      "   for name, age in zip(names, ages):\n",
      "       print(name, age)\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Best Practices:\n",
      "- **Keep it clear**: Ensure that the purpose of the loop is easily understood.\n",
      "- **Limit nested loops**: Try to avoid deep nesting of loops; it can make code less readable.\n",
      "- **Use descriptive variable names**: Choose names that indicate what data the loop is processing.\n",
      "- **Avoid infinite loops**: Be cautious with the conditions in your `while` loops to prevent them from running indefinitely.\n",
      "- **Pythonic loops with built-in functions**: Whenever possible, prefer using built-in functions like `map()`, `filter()`, or list comprehensions for cleaner and more efficient code.\n",

This phenomenon occurs because the CEO wants to maintain control and relevance over the area of expertise that brought them success, resulting in hiring someone who may not be as competent. The term is named after Michael Eisner, the former CEO of Disney, who struggled to effectively manage ABC after acquiring it, despite his expertise as a TV network executive. The issue emphasizes the importance of hiring strong executives rather than weak ones to ensure successful leadership in essential areas of a business.\",\n",
